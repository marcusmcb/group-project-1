# US Rental Analysis

For our first project, we decided to do an analysis of home rental prices in American cities.  Our primary observation was simply that rental prices in many American cities are high and have gone up considerably in recent years.

### Tools used:

* Python/Juypter
* Pandas/Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Plotly.JS
* Kaggle

### Data Sources Used:

Kaggle (www.kaggle.com)
US Census Data (www.census.gov)
Google Maps API

### Data Observations:

* Of the 17,000 individual cities surveyed within the Kaggle data used, home rental rates in the U.S. have increased annually by 1.7% on average between January 2011 and January 2017.

* The twenty largest cities in the United States have grown in population and have accordingly become more expensive, but the trend is not exclusive to that group. Houston and Dallas, ranked 4th and 10th respectively on city size, are both under the national average. 

* Detroit, the 17th largest American city, is the least expensive city among the one hundred largest cities to rent a home in ($750 average per month).

* The one hundred largest cities in the U.S. are paying $1533 per month on average, $66 more than the national average of $1467.

* Atherton, CA - with a population of 7,159 - had the highest average rental price in the U.S. at $16,575 per month.

* Flint, MI - the 246th largest city in the U.S. - had the lowest average rents per month at $549.

* Rental vacancy across the United States decreased from 9.7% to 6.6% between 2010 and 2018.
